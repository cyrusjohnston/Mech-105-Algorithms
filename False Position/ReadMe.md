This folders contains an algorithm that uses the false position technique to determine the location of a root of a function.
1. *Inputs*
  **func** = the function being evaluated
  **xl** = the lower bound
  **xu** = the upper bound
  **es** = stopping criterion (a percentage)
  **maxit** = the maixmum number of iterations possible
2. *Outputs*
  **root** = the location of the root
  **f(x)*8 = the value of f(x) at the location of the root
  **ea** = the calculated approximate error
  **iter** = the number of iterations calculated
