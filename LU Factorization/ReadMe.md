This folder contains an algorithm that computes the LU decomposition of a matrix. This algorithm utilizes pivoting. LU decomposition can be used to solve square systems of linear equations and is a neccessary step when inverting a matrix or computing the determinant of a matrix.

*Inputs*
  
  **A** = a square matrix
  
*Outputs*

  **L** = the calculated lower triangular matrix
  
  **U** = the calculated upper triangular matrix
  
  **P** = the final pivot matrix
