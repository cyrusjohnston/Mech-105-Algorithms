This folder contains an algorithm that copmputes the linear regression of a data set. This algorithm removes outliers from the data set before calculating
the slope and intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b, as well as the R^2 value, aka the coefficient of determination.

*Inputs*

  **x** = the x-values of a data set

  **y** = the y-values of a data set

*Outputs*

  **fX** = the x-values of the data set with outliers removed
  
  **fY** = the y-values of the data set with outliers removed
  
  **slope** = the slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
  
  **intercept** = the intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
  
  **Rsquared** = the calculated coefficient of determination
