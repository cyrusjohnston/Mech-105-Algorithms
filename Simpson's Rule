This folder contains an algorithm for Simpson's 1/3 rule. This algorithm numerically evaluates the integral of a data set using Simpson's 1/3 rule.
Inputs
x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
y = the vector of function values with respect to x
Outputs:
I = the numerical integral calculated
If an odd number of segments are present in the data, a trapezodial rule will automatically be applied.
