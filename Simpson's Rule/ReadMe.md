This folder contains an algorithm for Simpson's 1/3 rule. This algorithm numerically evaluates the integral of a data set using Simpson's 1/3 rule.
1. *Inputs*:
**x** = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
**y** = the vector of function values with respect to x
2. *Outputs*:
**I** = the numerical integral calculated

If an odd number of segments are present in the data, a trapezodial rule will automatically be applied at the end of the Simpson's evaluation.
